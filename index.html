		<p><b>Since the 1973 Supreme Court ruling in Roe V. Wade, abortion has been legal in the United States. In the past decade, the number of abortions has decreased across the U.S. </b></p>

		<p>The causes of this decline are not certain, but reasons include wider access to contraceptives, better reproductive health education, and decreasing pregnancy rates across the country.</p>

		<p> Another factor may be the increasing legal and admnistrative obstacles to getting an abortion. </p>

		<p>Between 2010 and 2016, states have enacted nearly 30% of all abortion restriction laws since Roe V. Wade, according to Guttmacher Institute. These laws impose limits on the time period after which an abortion can still occur, as well as limits on abortion medications, insurance coverage, and restrictions on the types of facilities that may perform abortions.</p>

		<h3>Delaware's changing abortion landscape</h3>

		<p>Abortion rates decreased across the country between 2010-16, but Delaware saw a 46% decrease in abortions over that time period.</p>

		<p>While the cause of this decline is not clear, Guttmacher Institute notes there were fewer pregnancies across the U.S. in that time period and that access to contraceptives has been much easier since 2011.</p>
		
		<p>Since 2011, the Affordable Care Act mandates most private insurance covers contraceptives, without out-of-pocket costs.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://laterabortion.org/states/delaware">Later Abortion Initiative</a> considers Delaware's abortion laws "somewhat restrictive" because the state requires a 24-hour waiting period and written consent before an aabortion. It also requires the abortion to be performed by a licensed medical doctor and imposes other restrictions on the abortion providers.</p>

		<p>As in many other states, abortions must be performed within the first 20 weeks of the pregnancy. Later abortions are only allowed if the pregnancy threatens the pregnant woman's life.</p>
